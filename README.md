# FallGuysIdleBot
FallGuysIdleBot simulates keyboard inputs to start and end Fall Guys matches. This is useful for farming XP or completing quests. 
You will 99% not get banned, because other players just think you're AFK since enter doesn't do anything in FG by default.

Make sure you have the right game mode selected before starting the script!
