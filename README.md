## FG Client Update (v10.2.0):
> - New AFK detection feature : A pop-up will appear after 20 seconds, showing a 10 seconds countdown telling you to move : If you don't move, you will be kicked from the game, and an inactivity pop-up will appear once in the menu.


## General Information
- This program continuously presses enter on the keyboard, so we start and end a fall guys match continuously and appear AFK in-game. \
Make sure you have the right game mode selected before starting the script!

- This script will 99% not get you banned, because other players will just think you're AFK since enter doesn't do anything in fall guys by default
