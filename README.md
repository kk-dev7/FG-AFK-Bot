## FAQ
#### Can this script get me banned?
You will 99% not get banned, because other players just think you're AFK since enter doesn't do anything in FG by default.
 
#### How can I customize this script?
If you open the file with a text editor, you can edit the values for e.g. the key to press or the waiting time. 

#### Fall Guys released an update where AFK players are kicked out of the game... Does this script still work?
The game does not kick you out of the match if you're using this script.
